# NN-SAT-Verifier
It has been shown that adversarial inputs to neural networks can be generated using SMT solvers [1]. This project aims to explore these attacks in a simplified setting, based on Microsoft's open source z3 solver. See analysis/verification.py for the bulk of the logic of the solver.
